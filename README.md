# 🌿 GreenHarvest Rewards: Token-Based Incentives for Sustainable Agriculture

Welcome to GreenHarvest Rewards, a Web3 project on the Stacks blockchain that tackles climate change by rewarding farmers for adopting low-emission practices and contributing to global carbon sequestration efforts. By tokenizing rewards tied to verifiable carbon capture in agriculture, this system incentivizes sustainable farming, reduces greenhouse gases, and integrates with international carbon markets—all powered by Clarity smart contracts for transparency and security.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 Farmer registration and profile management
- 🔍 Verifiable submission of farming data (e.g., soil health, crop types, emission reductions)
- 🌍 Integration with global carbon sequestration standards via oracles
- 💰 Issuance of ERC-20-like reward tokens (GHV tokens) based on sequestration metrics
- 📈 Staking mechanism for compounded rewards and governance participation
- 🛒 Marketplace for trading carbon credits and tokens
- 🏆 Periodic reward distribution with compliance checks
- 🔒 Immutable audit trails for all transactions and verifications
- 🗳️ DAO governance for protocol updates and fund allocation

## 🛠 How It Works
GreenHarvest Rewards uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a decentralized ecosystem for sustainable agriculture. Farmers earn GHV tokens by proving low-emission practices, which can be staked, traded, or redeemed in carbon markets. Data verification relies on trusted oracles (e.g., integrating with real-world sensors or APIs for soil carbon levels).

### Key Smart Contracts
1. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Handles farmer onboarding, storing profiles (e.g., farm location, size) and ensuring unique identities.
2. **DataSubmission.clar**: Allows farmers to submit practice data (e.g., no-till farming, cover crops) with timestamps for immutability.
3. **EmissionVerifier.clar**: Verifies submitted data against standards using oracle inputs; calculates emission reductions.
4. **CarbonCalculator.clar**: Computes carbon sequestration credits based on verified data (e.g., tons of CO2 captured per hectare).
5. **GHVToken.clar**: Manages the fungible reward token (minting, burning, transfers) compliant with SIP-010 standards.
6. **StakingPool.clar**: Enables token staking for yield farming, with rewards distributed from a community pool.
7. **RewardDistributor.clar**: Periodically distributes tokens to eligible farmers based on sequestration scores; includes anti-fraud checks.
8. **CreditMarketplace.clar**: Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of carbon credits and tokens, with built-in escrow for secure exchanges.

**For Farmers**
- Register your farm via FarmerRegistry.
- Submit practice data to DataSubmission (e.g., upload hashes of sensor reports).
- Get verified through EmissionVerifier and CarbonCalculator.
- Receive GHV tokens from RewardDistributor—stake them in StakingPool for extra yields.

**For Validators/Oracles**
- Use EmissionVerifier to input real-world data (e.g., satellite imagery or soil tests) for automated checks.

**For Traders and Investors**
- Buy/sell GHV tokens or carbon credits on CreditMarketplace.
- Participate in governance via StakingPool to vote on protocol changes.

This setup solves real-world problems like agricultural emissions (which account for ~24% of global GHGs) by providing economic incentives, transparent tracking, and integration with efforts like the UN's carbon sequestration initiatives.
